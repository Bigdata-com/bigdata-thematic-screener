And that ontology and our willingness to stick to our guns again because there's been 1,000,000,000 and 1,000,000,000 and 1,000,000,000 of dollars invested in large language models, the idea that you could dare to build a product under that was built on the assumption that the power of large language models would be in their the ability to operationalize them in the context of the enterprise in common language.

This is truly a validation of our strategy to become the digitally driven HR leader.\nAs an example of how we are driving innovation in AI, we recently built a GenAI-powered HR Copilot tool that covers the HR questions most frequently asked by our clients. The tool was developed from our proprietary data sourced from the hundreds of thousands of conversations our HR professionals have with our clients every year. The HR Copilot tool will enable our HR professionals to leverage the collective knowledge base we have built over the years to drive both efficient and effective answers to our clients' concerns. The testing phase for this new tool is nearly complete, and we are on track to launch it at the start of our next fiscal year.

And Alexa Plus, which is the next generation of Alexa, uses AI even more expansively. And so there are several ways. I'll give you a few examples. First, we use automatic speech recognition to translate spoken words into text.\nAnd then we use natural language understanding to interpret the meaning and the intent behind those text words, which we either then represent in text on surfaces that use text, whether it's on an Alexa enabled screen or on the new mobile or desktop apps for Alexa Plus, or we translate that text back into speech when you hear it come out of an Alexa speaker or device. Alexa Plus has also re architected the brains orchestration of Alexa. And it's built on multiple foundation models, primarily on top of Amazon Nova, which is our own frontier model. And what this new brain is doing is it's better able to understand queries, to route them to the right experts, and respond more intelligently, and then to take action.

We can bring insights across the products into this data set and power insights through analytics assist through AI.\nSo there's more and more applications that come as a result of this One Data Platform. And most importantly, as we're taking the journey of AI, AI without data is not that effective. And having all the data in one place powers that AI innovation. So I hope it makes sense why that is a platform that continues to power innovation within ADP. So let's think about that at the database layer.\nLike if you think about a SaaS application, it has primarily three layers, database processing and the presentation layer. So let's go to ADP mobile.

First of all, how you integrate with AI is different from how you integrate classical business applications, if you will, right? For AI, the integration model really is contingent on having a unified data stream in which you can integrate both data assets to build AI models with. Secondly, to your question about the core, what is the surface that you're giving an AI system to interact with? If Workday would have just left the core as it is, right, what you said, just basically trying to bring AI over on top of it, that would be very ineffective.

It has robust multi-entity capabilities, advanced AI-powered automation that takes the power of AI and HI to the next level, and real-time business insights that actually help businesses make decisions on how to grow and where to invest.

With Flow Studio, Voxel was able to use AI to eliminate some of the more costly and complex parts of motion capture, such as a dedicated stage, specialized cameras, and expensive mocap suits. What previously would have taken weeks in traditional workflows, Voxel was able to accomplish in days, proving that Flow Studio can accelerate animation pipelines while also maintaining the quality necessary for high profile productions. This brings us to our final opportunity, transforming the production pipeline itself.",

It is limited to generating stock imagery and short montage style video clips. This is because it lacks the continuity, quality, and creative control needed for professional productions. Flow Studio changes that.\nIt combines the easy to use aspects of AI with the editability and control needed for professional workflows. This makes Flow Studio easy for anyone to create three d animation and visual effects, But it also allows you to output AI generated results as two d and three d components for editing and refining in professional software applications like Maya. Flow Studio is also an AI orchestrator. It works by combining multiple specialized AI models together to generate higher quality results faster. The orchestration and editability are key competitive differentiators compared to other AI approaches.",

Autodesk is creating foundation models with neural technology that are redefining our IP and represents a massive untapped opportunity. Every decision, every optimization, every piece of creative output flowing through our platform becomes a new source of value creation. Beyond that, we're expanding from design to make into operate. Operations represents a significant future opportunity across buildings, factories, and infrastructure. We're helping customers not just create these assets, but also run them, optimize them, and extract maximum value from them throughout the entire lifecycle.

These are normally the least efficient older manufacturing nodes that we have in the system. And as we've increased capacity throughout the system in the last few years, those nodes can go away.\nWe're also rationalizing our warehouse infrastructure, both in the context of some automation decisions that we're making and also some combination with the beverage business in some parts of the country.
