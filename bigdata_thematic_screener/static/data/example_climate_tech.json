Was there any incentive accrual or anything in the quarter that weighed on that? And maybe related to pricing also, the 1% to 1.5% for 2025, does that include - is that overall like including the EV portfolio? And do you expect some pricing on - pressure on EVs?",

It looks like you gained some pretty solid sequential traction there, with sales rising 40% from 3Q, driven by inexpensive EVs such as the Wuling Binguo.

And I think for the first time not for the first time, we worked hard at this over the last eighteen months to get a general appreciation that low carbon hydrogen has a very important role to play as people think about decarbonization in Europe because that's the only way you're going to get a cost competitive solution for decarbonization of large industries, which have substantive CO2 or greenhouse gas emissions. And I think that's probably where my commentary earlier on in my prepared remarks was reflecting on growing conversations and potential for regulatory change that will accept carbon capture and sequestration as an acceptable solution supporting low carbon hydrogen growth.

I always want to remind folks that the clause that we should be talking about and thinking about is 45Q, which predates the IRA. And that clause is supporting producing hydrogen using natural gas, converting that using an autothermal reformer or a steam methane reformer and taking the carbon dioxide that is produced, capturing it and sequestering it. And hence, that 45Q credit of $85 per tonne, which we feel reasonably confident at this point in time. I think I'm being brave in this world, but I feel confident that that has a support necessary as we move forward.

        "quote": "An asset manager client needed to launch a suite of active ETFs aligned with global ESG goals, including Paris-aligned criteria under SFDR Article 9, while minimizing tracking error and delivering differentiated products across global, U.S., Europe, and emerging markets. MSCI developed a tailored suite of custom climate indexes in alignment with Article 9 sustainability standards and our clients' investment objectives. The solution integrated MSCI ESG ratings and Paris-aligned climate criteria, providing a scalable, rules-based framework to support multi-region ETF rollout. This resulted in the launch of four actively managed ETFs, which raised a combined $1 billion in AUM with strong initial demand. The solution delivered carbon and decarbonization reporting across regions, supported local alignment, with end-to-end support from custom index design to product launch. This slide illustrates how we enable clients to attract AUM in complex markets with institutional-grade, rules-based custom indexing solutions.",
        "motivation": "MSCI Inc. developed a tailored suite of custom climate indexes in alignment with Article 9 sustainability standards, which clearly connects to Climate Technology by focusing on ESG goals and carbon reporting. The mention of carbon and decarbonization reporting indicates a direct link to climate-related financial products, thus justifying the label 'Government Incentives for Clean Tech'.",

        "quote": "The first question is, what has been done to improve emission reduction of FedEx aircraft since the 2024 annual meeting? FedEx is implementing comprehensive long-term actions and interim goals to achieve carbon neutrality in our own operations, as well as support the low-carbon transition of the broader transportation and logistics industry. Specifically, our areas of focus are vehicle electrification for our pickup and delivery fleet, sustainable energy for our facilities, and sustainable aviation fuel for our aircraft while we deploy a more fuel-efficient fleet. Notably, FedEx recently secured more than 3 million gallons of blended sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, for delivery at Los Angeles International Airport, which was the largest SAF purchase executed by a U.S. cargo airline at LAX as of May 2025, when FedEx first accepted delivery of the fuel. Additional information can be found in our 2025 Corporate Responsibility Report.",
        "motivation": "FedEx Corp. is explicitly focused on vehicle electrification and sustainable aviation fuel, which are directly related to Climate Technology. The mention of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) aligns with the label 'Alternative Fuels Development', as it involves the development and use of alternative fuels to reduce emissions in aviation.",
