These are the tools that enable more accurate forecasting, help us better position inventory to drive in stock speed and reduce costs. These new systems are now used by about 40% of the assortment. That's more than double the percentage that use them in 2023, progress we expect to continue in 2025 and beyond.",

So building these data centers are expensive, and they're really expensive if they're not full or they're not at least half full. So we tend to start small and then add capacity as demand arises. And that allows us to have higher utilization. That's one thing.\nThe other thing is we have a high degree of standardization and automation inside of our cloud. So the operating the cloud also gives us better margins. You will not see that on CapEx. That will be on operating profit. But it's really the combination of starting smaller and growing with demand that affects CapEx and then overall margins, the fact that we have a high degree of automation which lowers our labor cost dramatically.",

We continue to mitigate global economic risks like tariffs and political biases by regionalizing parts supply near its factories in North America, Berlin and Shanghai. For example, in North America, our high-volume vehicle programs have over 85% North America content and Shanghai vehicles have over 95% local content. Berlin has similar levels of regionalization as North American when you exclude the battery, and we are working on regionalizing the battery as well. This is a pre-pandemic strategy that we accelerated post-pandemic through supply diversification, dual-sourcing, vertical integration, advanced analytics, and local partnerships to ensure supply chain resilience and production stability. Having said that, we are not 100% insulated and these tariff rates are higher on our low volume platforms than the high volume ones.",

Look, the tariff could change three more times in the next two weeks, okay?\nAnd that's something that we can't forecast and also know our customers. But I will say that when we look at our footprint of manufacturing between The US and between Asia and Europe, and also look at the work we do with our external partners and foundries, we are well positioned. The issue is not then the capacity size. The issue is how quickly you can get your logistics and also the cycle time of starting new wafers, landing at customers to optimize the cost of the supply.

The tariff rates here are so substantial that they're likely to significantly reduce the volume of trade between the two countries. We expect this will impact the sales of our products in China that are produced by our facilities in the US. In our guidance, we're assuming this is a $400 million revenue headwind for the year. These tariffs are also expected to increase the cost of China sourced parts and subassemblies. The pull-through on the lower volumes and higher costs net of the aggressive mitigation actions is assumed to be a headwind of adjusted operating income in 2025 of $375 million versus our prior guide.

These recently raised tariffs are increasing our costs where we directly import items into the US, but also likely increase the cost of many items that we buy in the US that have an overseas content. A partial offset to the impact of these tariffs is foreign exchange. The increase in tariffs have caused a significant weakening of the US dollar, and at current rates, this increases our revenue guide for the year by $600 million. The bottom line benefit of the FX change is more muted given the mix of currencies and one time transactional FX caused by the recent rapid change in the rates. We're driving offsetting mitigation actions here as well, a combination of supply chain changes, actively managing our cost base and appropriate pricing actions.

Kenny already mentioned international intermodal probably had some challenges in the back half of the year.\nBut domestic seems to be set up pretty well. So how do you kind of manage resources for that volatility kind of within the intermodal segment, do you keep a level of resiliency in case things are kind of short-lived and kind of just focus on service and making sure you're prepared for the upturn? Or do you have to become a little bit more, I guess, drastic with some of the resource decisions that you make in the short-term?",

We certainly appreciate our ongoing engagement with Green Century and your interest in refillable packaging. First, let me let me start by reinforcing. We are still really focused on using refillable packaging. While we may not have a formal goal specifically for refillable, they remain a key part of our strategy and are ingrained in our business operations in many markets. So just as we seek to offer a portfolio of beverage options, we also seek to provide a portfolio of package options so that consumers can drink our beverages, whatever format they prefer, be that glass, plastic or cans as well as refillable or dispense format with reusable containers. So, we continue to grow our refillable volume and production lines, particularly where infrastructure exists.",

So, we're taking actions to offset that impact and to help us navigate the uncertainty in the environment. We're leveraging available programs. The administration is providing businesses such as duty drawbacks, along with other strategies to optimize our operations, like expanding the use of foreign trade zones.

Using Flight Deck, we deployed more than 550 of our engineering and supply chain resources into the supply base, and together, we work to identify labor shortfalls and manufacturing yield issues, alternate alternate material types for raw material shortages, and other opportunities to improve flow and lead time. As a result, we increased material input by 26% across these priority sites from the first half of the year to the second half. Importantly, we're sustaining these improvements through 2025 so far. To build on this progress, we brought together our engineering and supply chain teams into one organization, which we call technology and operations led by Muhammad Ali.",

As you can see, most of our gross impact is driven by the 125% reciprocal tariff on imports from China while the Mexico impact is significantly mitigated as 80% of our supply into the US from Mexico qualifies for USMCA exemptions. In 2025, we expect the gross incremental impact on US imports to be $185 million, around 1% of sales. Now to quantify the tariff impact of US exports into our China operations, we exported $105 million of critical subassemblies and some finished product from the US to China in 2024 on an annualized basis. Under the third round of China's retaliatory tariffs, which went into effect on April 10, we are now exposed to $135 million of incremental cost on an annualized basis.",

It's almost one-third of the driver of the 300%. The second, because we're combining everything on one platform, we're driving automation across the platform, eliminating manual work across money in, money out, payroll. They're saving a ton of money through automation. They don't need as many people. Third, we're consolidating their tech stack. You remember the slide I showed you earlier with 25 different apps?

Now that Alejandra has identified ways to lower her material costs, she wants to turn her attention to labor costs, and she asks what to do.
